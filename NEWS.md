# rix 0.2.0 (2023-08-25)

## New features

- Updated Nix historical revision data to include R version 4.3.1.
- Provision a new `shell_hook` arg for `rix::rix()`, which will create a `shellHook` entry in `default.nix`.

## Bug fixes

- `inst/extdata/default.nix`: use `R --vanilla` in shellHook to not propagate user-specific `.Renviron` and `.Rprofile`. Fixes #56


# rix 0.1.2 (2023-08-14)

# Bug fixes

- Patch `inst/exdata/default.nix` so that `LOCALE_ARCHIVE` shellHook that was set to 
  glibc locale does not fail on MacOS anymore 
  ([#40](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/issues/48); fixed with [37f7ab8](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/commit/37f7ab84e5423721bdf05e41816dbc99353481e7)).
- `nix_build()`: fix defensive check so the error message is referring to `project_path`
  instead of `nix_file`. The patch does not change correct behavior of `nix_build()`, 
  hence it is only of cosmetic nature.


# rix 0.1.1 (2023-08-11)

# Bug fixes

- `nix_build()` now correctly checks presence of `nix-build`. ([4be69b2](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/commit/4be69b2c438276a1f636f3b407a124555bb12c9b))


# rix 0.1.0 (2023-08-11)

## New features

- Added `nix_build()` helper that runs `nix-build` interactively from R. 
  ([#22](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/pull/22))
- `rix()` now supports installing packages from GitHub and the CRAN archives.
- `rix()` now supports using a `nixpkgs` revision instead of an R version 
  for reproducibility
- Generated `default.nix` files now also include the call that was made to 
  generate them as top-level comment.

## Changes

- The `path` argument of `rix()` changed to `project_path`.


# rix (development version)

- Basic functionality added.
