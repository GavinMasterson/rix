The code below generates the `default.nix` file included in the package
at `inst/extdata`. You can use the call below in case you want to generate
an environment with `{rix}` only.

The latest commit gets used automatically:


```{r eval = T}
library(rix)

api_url <- "https://api.github.com/repos/b-rodrigues/rix/commits?sha=master"

response <- httr::GET(url = api_url)

commit_data <- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(response, "text"))
latest_commit <- commit_data$sha[1]

rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = NULL,
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = list(
      package_name = "rix",
      repo_url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/",
      branch_name = "master",
      commit = latest_commit
    ),
    ide = "other",
    project_path = "inst/extdata",
    overwrite = TRUE,
    shell_hook = NULL)
