## Introduction and installation

The goal of `{rix}` is to provide an easy way to generate `default.nix` files.
These files are used by the Nix package manager to build an environment
according to the instructions defined in it. Users can specify which version of
R, R packages, other needed software, IDE etc should be available within that
environment. Writing such files can be daunting for newcomers, and so `{rix}`
provides a function called `rix()`, which takes care of the bulk of the work

`{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed to generate `default.nix` files, so
you could generate the file on one machine, and then build and use the
environment on another machine that has Nix installed on it (or on a CI/CD
service like Github Actions for example). If you wish to fully take advantage of
Nix, I suggest you use [Determinate System's
installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install). Nix can be installed on
Linux, macOS and Windows (but on Windows WSL2 must be enabled).

On Linux, once Nix is instaled, all the software that will be installed will be
saved to the `/nix` directory on the root partition. Complete development
environments built with Nix can take up much space, so if the available space on
your root parttion is limited, I advise you to mount the `/nix` folder on
another partition with more space (for example, a secondary hard drive). For
this, edit `/etc/fstab` and add the following line at the end:

```
/home/path_to/nix /nix none bind 0 0
```

This will map `/nix` to `/home/path_to/nix` which can be on a larger partition.
If you have enough space on your root partition, you can ignore the above
instructions.


## Nix environments

An environment built by Nix is not totally isolated from the rest of the system.
Suppose that you the program `sl` installed on your system, and suppose you
build a Nix environment that also comes with `sl`. If you activate that
environment, the version of `sl` that will run when called is the one included
in the Nix environment. If, however, you start `sl` in a Nix environment that
does not come with it, then your system's `sl` will get used instead. This can
be useful when working interactively with a Nix environment, because you can use
your usual IDE to work with it. The only exception is RStudio: RStudio looks for
R in predefined paths and cannot "see" the R provided by a Nix environment, it
will instead use the version installed on your machine. This means that if you
use RStudio to work interactively with R, you will need to install RStudio
inside that environment. `rix::rix()` can generate a `default.nix` file that
does that.


## Day-to-day use of {rix}

The ideal workflow when using `{rix}` is to create a new, separate environment
at the start of a project. Let's say that you wish to analyse some data set, and
need `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}`. Let's also suppose that you use RStudio as your
IDE. With the `rix::rix()` function, you can easily generate the right
`default.nix` file. You need to provide the following inputs to `rix()`:

- `r_ver`: the version of R required. Use "current" for the latest version;
- `r_pkgs`: the required R packages. For example "dplyr";
- `other_pkgs`: the required system packages, if needed. For example "quarto", or a Python interpreter;
- `git_pkgs`: list of git packages to add. See the example below;
- `ide`: the integrated development editor to use. For example "rstudio" if you want to use RStudio. Refer to the "Interactive work with {rix}" for more details;
- `path`: the path where to save the `default.nix` file.
- `overwrite`: whether to overwrite the `default.nix` file or not.

In such a situation, you could create an environment with the following call to `rix()`:


```{r}
path_default_nix <- tempdir()

rix(r_ver = "current",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    other_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "rstudio",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

This generates the following `default.nix` file:


```{r echo = F}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

To start using this environment, open a console in the folder containing
`default.nix` and use the following Nix command:

```
nix-build
```

`nix-build` is a Nix command that builds an environment according to the
specifications found in a `default.nix` file. Once the environment is done
building, you should find a new file called `result` next to the `default.nix`
file. This file is a symlink to the software installed by Nix. To now use the
environment, type:

```
nix-shell
```

You can now start the RStudio provided by that environment by typing `rstudio`.
This will start a version of RStudio specific to this environment. If you
already had RStudio installed by using your operating system's installer, that
version of RStudio will not be able to interact with Nix environments. This is
because RStudio looks for R in certain specific paths that don't include any Nix
environments. This is not the case with other editors like Visual Studio Code or
Emacs. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use the following call to `rix()`:


```{r}
path_default_nix <- tempdir()

rix(r_ver = "current",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    other_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "code",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

(note the value provided to the `ide` argument).

This generates the following `default.nix` file:


```{r echo = F}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

As you can see, specifying `ide = "code"` adds the `{languageserver}` package to
the list of packages that must be installed for this environment. This is
because Visual Studio Code requires this package to interact with R. This will
not install a Nix environment-specific version of Visual Studio Code. Now,
instead of typing `rstudio` in the Nix shell of your environment, type `code`
and this will start the Visual Studio Code you usually use.

If you use another editor, like Emacs, then use `ide = "other"`, and start that
editor inside an activated Nix environment.

For more details on interactive use, read the "Interactive use" vignette.


## Running old projects with {rix}

The example below shows how to create a `default.nix` with instructions to build
an environment with R version 4.2.1, the `{dplyr}` and `{janitor}` packages and
no specific IDE:


```{r}
path_default_nix <- tempdir()

rix(r_ver = "4.2.1",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "janitor"),
    other_pkgs = c("quarto"),
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "other",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)

```

The file looks like this:


```{r echo = F}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

The first line is quite important, as it shows which *revision* of `nixpkgs` is
being used for this environment. The *revision* is the commit hash of that
particular release of `nixpkgs`, here: `79b3d4bcae8`. This revision of `nixpkgs`
is the one that shipped version 4.2.1 of R, so the `{dplyr}` and `{janitor}`
packages that will get installed will be the versions available in that revision
as well. This means that R versions and package versions are always coupled when
using Nix. However, if you need a specific version of R, but also a specific
version of a package that is not available in that particular Nix revision, one
solution is to install that package from Github.


## Installing old packages archived on CRAN

It is also possible to install an arbitrary version of a package that has
been archived on CRAN:


```{r}
rix(r_ver = "4.2.1",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr@0.8.0", "janitor@1.0.0"),
    other_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "other",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

This feature should ideally be used sparingly. If you want to reconstruct an
environment as it was around 2019, use the version of R that was current at the
time. This will ensure that every package that gets installed is at a version
compatible with that version of R, which might not be the case if you need to
install a very old version of one particular package.


## Installing packages from Github

It is also possible to install packages from Github:


```{r}
rix(r_ver = "4.2.1",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "janitor"),
    other_pkgs = c("quarto"),
    git_pkgs = list(
                 list(package_name = "housing",
                   repo_url = "https://github.com/rap4all/housing/",
                   branch_name = "fusen",
                   commit = "1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e"),
                 list(package_name = "fusen",
                   repo_url = "https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fusen",
                   branch_name = "main",
                   commit = "d617172447d2947efb20ad6a4463742b8a5d79dc")
    ),
    ide = "other",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)

```

```{r}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

This will install two packages from Github: the `{housing}` package and more
specifically the code as it is in the `fusen` branch. The commit is also
provided, to pin the exact version of the package needed. The `{fusen}` package
is also installed, from the main branch at commit `d617172447d`.


## A complete example

This example shows how all features of `{rix}` can work together:


```{r}
rix(r_ver = "4.2.1",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "janitor@1.0.0"),
    other_pkgs = c("quarto"),
    git_pkgs = list(
                 list(package_name = "housing",
                   repo_url = "https://github.com/rap4all/housing/",
                   branch_name = "fusen",
                   commit = "1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e"),
                 list(package_name = "fusen",
                   repo_url = "https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fusen",
                   branch_name = "main",
                   commit = "d617172447d2947efb20ad6a4463742b8a5d79dc")
    ),
    ide = "rstudio",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)

```

```{r}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```
