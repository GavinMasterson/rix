# Rix: Reproducible Environments with Nix

## Introduction

`{rix}` is an R package that provides functions to help you write Nix
expressions: these expressions can then be used by the Nix package manager to
build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can
be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD
environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages
that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of
software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of
CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful:
not only it handles all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is
also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of
software. It is thus possible to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0
(for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R.

With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace `{renv}` and Docker combined. If
you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done
easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).

## Returning users

*If you are not familiar with Nix or `{rix}` skip to the next section.*

If you are already familiar with Nix and R, and simply want to get started as
quickly as possible, you can start by installing Nix using the installer from
[Determinate
Systems](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer) a company
that provides services and tools built on Nix:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
    -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
     sh -s -- install
```

If you have R installed, you can start straight away from your R session by first
installing `{rix}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
library("rix")
```

You can try that everything works well by trying to built the Nix expression
that ships with `{rix}`. Nix expressions are typically saved into files with the
name `default.nix`. This expression installs the latest version of R and `{rix}`
in a separate, reproducible environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.copy(
  # default.nix is the file containing the Nix expression
  from = system.file("extdata", "default.nix", package = "rix"),
  to = ".", overwrite = TRUE
)

# nix_build() is a wrapper around the command line tool `nix-build`
nix_build(project_path = ".")
```

If everything worked well, you should see a file called `result` next to
`default.nix`. You can now enter this newly built development environment by
starting opening a terminal in that folder and typing `nix-shell`. You should
be immediately dropped into an interactive R session.

If you don't have R installed, but have the Nix package manager installed, you
can run a temporary R session with R using this command (it will build the same
environment as the one above):

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rix/master/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

You can then create new development environment definitions, build them, and
start using them.

## The Nix package manager

Nix is a package manager that can be installed on your computer (regardless of
OS) and can be used to install software like with any other package manager. If
you're familiar with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, you likely have used
`apt-get` to install software. On macOS, you may have used `homebrew` for
similar purposes. Nix functions in a similar way, but has many advantages over
classic package managers. The main advantage of Nix, at least for our purposes,
is that its repository of software is huge. As of writing, it contains more than
80.000 packages, and the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor is available through
Nix's repositories. This means that using Nix, it is possible to install not
only R, but also all the packages required for your project. The obvious
question is why use Nix instead of simply installing R and R packages as usual.
The answer is that Nix makes sure to install every dependency of any package, up
to required system libraries. For example, the `{xlsx}` package requires the
Java programming language to be installed on your computer to successfully
install. This can be difficult to achieve, and `{xlsx}` bullied many R
developers throughout the years (especially those using a Linux distribution,
`sudo R CMD javareconf` still plagues my nightmares). But with Nix, it suffices
to declare that we want the `{xlsx}` package for our project, and Nix figures
out automatically that Java is required and installs and configures it. It all
just happens without any required intervention from the user. The second
advantage of Nix is that it is possible to *pin* a certain *revision* of the Nix
packages' repository (called `nixpkgs`) for our project. Pinning a revision
ensures that every package that Nix installs will always be at exactly the same
versions, regardless of when in the future the packages get installed.

## Rix workflow

The idea of `{rix}` is for you to declare the environment you need, using the
provided `rix()` function, which in turn writes the required expression in a
file for Nix to actually build that environment. You can then use this
environment to either work interactively, or run R scripts. It is possible to
have as many environments as projects. Each environment is isolated (or not,
it's up to you).

The main function of `{rix}` is called `rix()`. `rix()` has several arguments:

- the R version you need for your project
- a list of R packages that your project needs
- an optional list of additional software (for example, a Python interpreter, or Quarto)
- an optional list with packages to install from Github
- an optional list of LaTeX packages
- whether you want to use RStudio as an IDE for your project (or VS Code, or another environment)
- a path to save a file called `default.nix`.

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "chronicler"),
    ide = "rstudio")
```

The call above writes a `default.nix` file in the current working directory.
This `default.nix` can in turn be used by Nix to build an environment containing
RStudio, the latest version of R, and the latest versions of the `{dplyr}` and
`{chronicler}` packages. It should be noted that as of September 2023, RStudio
is not available for macOS through Nix so the expression generated by the call
above will not build successfully. It is also not possible to use RStudio
installed by other means with a Nix environment. This is because RStudio changes
some default environment variables and a globally installed RStudio (the one you
install normally) would not recognize the R installed in the Nix environment.
This is not the case for other IDEs such as VS code or Emacs. Another example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "4.2.2", r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "chronicler"), ide = "code")
```

This call will generate a `default.nix` that installs R version 4.2.2, with the
`{dplyr}` and `{chronicler}` packages. Because the user wishes to use VS Code,
the `ide` argument was set to "code". This installs the required
`{languageserver}` package as well, but unlike `ide = "rstudio"` does not
install VS Code in that environment. Users should instead use the globally
installed VS Code by starting it from that environment.

It's also possible to install specific versions of packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "latest", r_pkgs = c("dplyr@1.0.0"), ide = "code")
```

but usually it is better to build an environment using the version of R that was
current at the time of the release of `{dplyr}` version 1.0.0, instead of using
the current version of R and install an old package. It is also possible to
specify software to install alongside R and R packages with `rix()`, read the
[Building reproducible development environments with rix
vignette](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/articles/building-reproducible-development-environments-with-rix.html)
for more details.

For more details on how to use a Nix environment using an IDE interactively,
read the [Interactive
use](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/articles/interactive-use.html) vignette.

### default.nix

The Nix package manager can be used to build reproducible development
environments according to the specifications found in a file called
`default.nix`, which contains an *expression*, in Nix jargon. To make it easier
for R programmers to use Nix, `{rix}` can be used to write this file for you.
`{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed, so you could generate expressions
and use them on other machines. To actually build an environment using a
`default.nix`, file, go to where you chose to write it (ideally in a new, empty
folder that will be the root folder of your project) and use the Nix package
manager to build the environment. Call the following function in a terminal:

```
nix-build
```

`{rix}` also has a `nix_build()` helper function, so you can build environments
from an active R session if needed.

Once Nix is done building the environment, you can start working on it
interactively by using the following command in a terminal emulator (not the R
console):

```
nix-shell
```

You will *drop* into a Nix shell. You can now call the IDE of your choice. For
RStudio, simply call:

```
rstudio
```

This will start RStudio. RStudio will use the version of R and library of
packages from that environment.

### Running programs from an environment

You could create a bash script that you put in the path to make this process
more streamlined. For example, if your project is called `housing`, you could
create this script and execute it to start your project:

```
!#/bin/bash
nix-shell /absolute/path/to/housing/default.nix --run rstudio
```

This will execute RStudio in the environment for the `housing` project. If you
use `{targets}` you could execute the pipeline in the environment by running:

```
cd /absolute/path/to/housing/ && nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

It's possible to execute the pipeline automatically using a so-called "shell
hook". See the
[Reproducible analytical pipelines with Nix](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/articles/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-with-nix.html)
vignette for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rix from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-rodrigues/rix")
```

Or you can install it from the [{rix}
r-universe](https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev/rix), which serves you from a
CRAN-like R package repository:

```r
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

As stated above, `{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed to generate
`default.nix` files. But if you are on a machine on which R is not already
installed, and you want to start using `{rix}` to generate `default.nix` files,
you could first start by installing Nix, and then use the following command to
drop into a temporary Nix shell that comes with R and `{rix}` pre-installed:

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rix/master/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

This should immediately start an R session inside your terminal. You can now run
something like this:

```
rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "rstudio",
    project_path = ".",
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

to generate a `default.nix`, and then use that file to generate an environment
with R, Rstudio, `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}`. If you need to add packages for your
project, rerun the command above, but add the needed packages to `r_pkgs`.

## Installing Nix

### Windows pre-requisites

If you are on Windows, you need the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) to run
Nix. If you are on a recent version of Windows 10 or 11, you can simply run this
as an administrator in PowerShell:

```
wsl --install
```

You can find further installation notes at [this official MS
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

We recommend to activate systemd in Ubuntu WSL2, mainly because this supports 
other users than `root` running Nix. To set this up, please do as outlined
[this official Ubuntu blog entry](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-wsl-enable-systemd):

```sh
# in WSL2 Ubuntu shell
sudo -i
nano /etc/wsl.conf
# add this entry
[boot]
systemd=true
# then restart running instance from PowerShell
wsl --shutdown
# relaunch Ubuntu WSL2
```

Afterwards, you can install Nix like business as usual. You can proceed with
the Determinant Systems installer. If you cannot or have decided not to activate
systemd, then you have to append `--init none` to the command. More details
about this you can find at 
[The Determinante Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

### Installing Nix using the Determinate Systems installer

To make installation and de-installation of Nix simple, we recommend the
Determinate Systems installer which you can find
[here](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install). This installer works for any
system and make [uninstalling Nix very easy as
well](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/uninstall).

### Docker

You can also try out Nix inside Docker. To do so, you can start your image from
the [NixOS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix/). NixOS is a full
GNU/Linux distribution that uses Nix as its system package manager.

## Contributing

This package is developed using the `{fusen}` package. If you want to
contribute, please edit the `.Rmd` files found in the `dev/` folder. Then,
inflate the package using `fusen::inflate_all()`. If no errors are found
(warning and notes are ok), then commit and open a PR. To learn how to use
`{fusen}` (don't worry, it's super easy), refer to this
