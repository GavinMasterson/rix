# Reproducible Environments with Nix

## Introduction

`{rix}` is an R package that leverages Nix, a powerful package manager focusing
on reproducible builds. With Nix, it is possible to create project-specific
environments that contain a project-specific version of R and R packages (as
well as other tools or languages, if needed). You can use `{rix}` and Nix to
replace `{renv}` and Docker with one single tool. Nix is an incredibly useful
piece of software for ensuring reproducibility of projects, in research or
otherwise, or for running web applications like Shiny apps or `{plumber}` APIs
in a controlled environment.

Nix has quite a high entry cost though, because Nix is a complex piece of
software that comes with its own programming language (also called Nix) whose
purpose is to solve a complex problem: installing software in a reproducible
manner, on any operating system or hardware.

`{rix}` provides functions to help you write Nix expressions (written in the Nix
language): these expressions can then be used by the Nix package manager to
build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can
be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD
environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages
that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of
software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of
CRAN and Bioconductor packages. It is also possible to install older releases of
packages, or install packages from GitHub.

The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: not only it handles all the
dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to
reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible
to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old
project originally developed on that version of R.

As stated above, with Nix, it is essentially possible to replace `{renv}` and
Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this
can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via
WSL2) and `{rix}` comes with the following features:

- install any version of R and R packages for specific projects;
- have several versions of R and R packages installed at the same time on the
  same system;
- define complete development environments as code and use them anywhere;
- run single function in a different environment (potentially with a different R
  version and R packages) for an interactive R session and get back the output
  of that function using `with_nix()`;
  
`{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed on your system to generate
expressions. This means that you can generate expressions on a system on which
you cannot easily install software, and then use these expressions on the cloud
or on a CI/CD environment to build the project there.

## Quick start for returning users

*If you are not familiar with Nix or `{rix}` skip to the next section.*

If you are already familiar with Nix and R, and simply want to get started as
quickly as possible, you can start by installing Nix using the installer from
[Determinate
Systems](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer) a company
that provides services and tools built on Nix:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
    -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
     sh -s -- install
```

If you have R installed, you can start straight away from your R session by first
installing `{rix}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

library("rix")
```

You can check that everything works well by trying to build the Nix expression
that ships with `{rix}`. Nix expressions are typically saved into files with the
name `default.nix` or `shell.nix`. This expression installs the latest version
of R and `{rix}` in a separate, reproducible environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.copy(
  # default.nix is the file containing the Nix expression
  from = system.file("extdata", "default.nix", package = "rix"),
  to = ".", overwrite = TRUE
)

# nix_build() is a wrapper around the command line tool `nix-build`
nix_build(project_path = ".")
```

If everything worked well, you should see a file called `result` next to
`default.nix`. You can now enter this newly built development environment by
opening a terminal in that folder and typing `nix-shell`. You should
be immediately dropped into an interactive R session.

If you don't have R installed, but have the Nix package manager installed, you
can run a temporary R session with R using this command (it will build the same
environment as the one above):

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rix/master/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

You can then create new development environment definitions, build them, and
start using them.

## Getting started for new users

To get started with `{rix}` and Nix, you should read the following vignette
`vignette("1-getting_started")`. The vignettes are numbered to get you to learn
how to use `{rix}` and Nix smoothly. There’s a lot of info, so take your time
reading the vignettes. Don’t hesitate to open an issue if something is not
clear.

### Docker

You can also try out Nix inside Docker. To do so, you can start your image from
the [NixOS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix/). NixOS is a full
GNU/Linux distribution that uses Nix as its system package manager.

## Contributing

This package is developed using the `{fusen}` package. If you want to
contribute, please edit the `.Rmd` files found in the `dev/` folder. Then,
inflate the package using `fusen::inflate_all()`. If no errors are found
(warning and notes are OK), then commit and open a PR. To learn how to use
`{fusen}` (don't worry, it's super easy), refer to this
[vignette](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/articles/How-to-use-fusen.html).
In our development workflow, we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)
via [{fledge}](https://fledge.cynkra.com).
