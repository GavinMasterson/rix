## Introduction

Most of the software that the Nix package manager installs gets built from source, which
can take a very long time. For example, installing R or RStudio from source could take
up several hours, dependending on your hardware. Some R packages also must be compiled, so
depending on the environment you need, this could take several hours to build.

Thankfully, packages get pre-build using [Hydra](https://hydra.nixos.org/project/nixpkgs), 
and the resulting binaries are then made avaible on NixOSâ€™s [public cache](https://cache.nixos.org/).
Concretely, this means that you likely will never have to build packages from source: the
Nix package manager first checks if what you need is in the public cache, and if yes, it downloads
a binary from there instead of building it on your computer. This means that building an environment
is just a matter of waiting for packages to download.
