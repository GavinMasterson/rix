## Introduction

Most of the software that the Nix package manager installs gets built from source, which
can take a very long time. For example, installing R or RStudio from source could take
up several hours, dependending on your hardware. Some R packages also must be compiled, so
depending on the environment you need, this could take several hours to build. This
vignette will explain how you can cut down on building times by building the environment
once, and then caching it, so you don’t need to rebuild it on new machines.

Most packages you will need, get pre-build using [Hydra](https://hydra.nixos.org/project/nixpkgs), 
and the resulting binaries are then made avaible on NixOS’s [public cache](https://cache.nixos.org/).
Concretely, this means that you likely will never have to build packages from source: the
Nix package manager first checks if what you need is in the public cache, and if yes, it downloads
a binary from there instead of building it on your computer. This means that building an environment
is just a matter of waiting for packages to download.

However, if you use `rix::rix(r_ver = "bleeding", ...)`, you will generate an expression that
when built will result in an environment with bleeding edge R packages. These packages will get installed
from source, and so it could take a very long time to build. This is where we advise that you first: use
our cache on top of the public cache (as explained in `vignette("z-bleeding_edge")`), and then, if our
cache didn’t cover your needs, set up your own if you had to build many packages from source. This vignette
explains how.

## Using Github Actions to build the environment

Before creating a cache to hold the binaries for your development environment, you first need to build the 
environment once. You can build the environment on your computer, or on Github Actions. The advantage
of using Github Actions is that you can automate the process of building and pushing the binaries each time
you change the definition of the environment.

For example, imagine you have the following `generate_env.R` file for a project, which you version on Github:

```
library(rix)

rix(r_ver = "bleeding",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    tex_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "rstudio",
    project_path = ".")
```

if you add a packages to it, or re-run it, you’ll end up with a new `default.nix` file, and so you will need to
rebuild the environment. Again, depending on the packages you include, this could take quite some time to build.
To generate a Github Actions workflow file that will build the environment on Github Actions, run 
`rix::ga_cachix(cache_name = "", path = "")` where `cache_name` is the name of the cache you made on Cachix, and
`path` is the path to the `default.nix` file generated by `generate_env.R`.
