## Introduction

Isolated environments are great to run pipelines in a safe and reproducible
manner. This vignette details how to build a reproducible analytical pipeline
using an environment built with Nix that contains the rigt version of R and
packages.

## Running a {targets} pipeline

If you use `{targets}` you could execute the pipeline in the environment by
running:

```
nix-shell /absolute/path/to/housing/default.nix --run Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'
```

It's possible to execute the pipeline automatically using a so-called "shell
hook". See the "Non-interactive use" vignette for more details.
