Adhering to sound versioning practices is crucial for ensuring the
reproducibility of software. Despite the expertise in software engineering, the
ever-growing complexity and continuous development of new, potentially
disruptive features present significant challenges in maintaining code
functionality over time. This pertains not only to backward compatibility but
also to future-proofing. When code handles critical production loads and relie
on numerous external software libraries, it's likely that these dependencies
will evolve. While infrastructure-as-code and other DevOps principles shine in
addressing these challenges, they may appear less approachable and more
labor-intensive for the average R developer.

Are you ready to test your custom R functions and system commands with pure,
isolated software builds and runtimes directly from the R console

Nix is the cake but the dessert comes at a price.
