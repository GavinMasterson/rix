## Introduction

This vignette describes interactive use of environments built with `{rix}` using
a GUI editor like RStudio. I will discuss two scenarios: one in which you
already have R and RStudio installed on your operating system using the usual
installation method for your operating system, and another in which you used
Nix to install R and RStudio (or any other IDE).

## Scenario 1: you installed R and RStudio as usual

Let's suppose that you are already running R and RStudio and that you wish to
start using `{rix}` to define reproducible environments for your new projects
henceforth. These environments will get built using the Nix package manager and
will not only include the required R packages for your project but also a
specific version of R.

## Scenario 2: you install R and RStudio using Nix

## Other IDEs
