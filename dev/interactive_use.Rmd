## Introduction

This vignette describes interactive use of environments built with `{rix}` using
a GUI editor like RStudio. I will discuss two scenarios: one in which you
already have R and RStudio installed on your operating system using the usual
installation method for your operating system, and another in which you used
Nix to install R and RStudio (or any other IDE).

## Scenario 1: you installed R and RStudio as usual

Let's suppose that you are already running R and RStudio and that you wish to
start using `{rix}` to define reproducible environments for your new projects
henceforth. These environments will get built using the Nix package manager and
will not only include the required R packages for your project but also a
specific version of R. If you are used to using RStudio, then you also need to
install RStudio using Nix. To run this project specific version of RStudio, you
then need to activate the environment before running this project-specific
version of RStudio. Suppose for example that you generated a `default.nix` file
for a project called "kmeans", and suppose that this project is in the following
path: `~/Documents/kmeans` (on Windows it would be something like
`C:\Users\Billy\Documents\kmeans`). Navigate to that folder using your terminal,
and then run `nix-shell`. You will then be *dropped into* a Nix shell. From there
you can type `rstudio` to run this project specific version of RStudio with all
the packages. You can then work on it as usual.

You can also define a shortcut to a project that will take care of activating
the environment and launching rstudio. For example, you could define a bash alias
like this:

```
alias kmeans='nix-shell ~/Documents/kmeans/default.nix --run rstudio
```

which would then execute RStudio in the right project by simply typing `kmeans`
in a terminal. It's also possible to create an executable script that you can
save in your PATH:

```
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#!nix-shell /home/Billy/Document/kmeans/default.nix -i bash
rstudio
```

Name this script something like `kmeans_project`, make it executable (using
`chmod +x kmeans_project`) and now you can run RStudio within this environment
from anywhere.

## Scenario 2: you install R and RStudio using Nix

In case you don't have R installed, you cannot use the `{rix}` package to
generate new expressions. In this case you might consider installing Nix first,
and then using the expression below, which will install the latest development
version of `{rix}` and R:

```
{ pkgs ? import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8.tar.gz") {} }:

with pkgs;

let
  bootstrap_env = rWrapper.override {
    packages = with rPackages; [

    (buildRPackage {
      name = "rix";
      src = fetchgit {
      url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/";
      branchName = "master";
      rev = "935fb194b38adfb085a5bda9ebe5dc5bb504f2cb";
      sha256 = "sha256-qMKcBcoemx3CcayA0Vt3LcDCAskhWyWXJBJVN8BaIOw=";
      };
    propagatedBuildInputs = [
      httr
      jsonlite
    ];
      })
    ];
  };
in
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [bootstrap_env];
  shellHook = "R";
}

```

Save this into a `default.nix` file and run `nix-build` then `nix-shell` to drop
into an R console. From there you can start using `{rix}` to generate new and
more complex environments.
