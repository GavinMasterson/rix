## Introduction

It is important to understand the release cycle of the rPackages set and what steps you should take
if you need bleeding edge packages. R packages on nixpkgs tend to get updated alongside a new release of R, 
and the reason is to ensure a certain level of quality. The vast majority of CRAN (and Bioconductor) packages 
made available through `nixpkgs` in a fully automated way. But some packages do require some manual intervention
to work on Nix, and we only know this if we try to build these packages, but building packages requires quite 
a lot of resources. We can’t build CRAN packages every single day to see if everything works well on Nix, 
so we only rebuild the whole tree whenever there’s a new release of R. Packages get built on a CI infrastructure 
called *Hydra*, and then these packages get cached on [cache.nixos.org](cache.nixos.org) so whenever someone 
wants to install a package, a pre-built binary gets pulled from the cache instead of getting installed from source. 
For packages that don’t need compiling this is not that big of a time save, but for packages that do need to get compiled it is huge. 
Depending on which packages you want to install, if you had to build everything from source, it could potentially take hours, 
but if you can install pre-built binaries it’s just a matter of how quick your internet connection is.
