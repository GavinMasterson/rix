# Contributing

## Development environment

We provide a `default.nix` file that defines the right development environment
if you already are a Nix user and wish to contribute to the package. This
development environment will provide the required R packages to allow you to
work on `{rix}`. This development environment is pinned to a specific `nixpkgs`
commit, so it does not reflect the current status on CRAN. This is why it's also
important to make sure that contributions work on `rhub`.

## {fledge}

In our development workflow, we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)
via [{fledge}](https://fledge.cynkra.com).

## Discussions

For general discussion about the package, open a discussion on

request features, open an issue <https://github.com/ropensci/rix/issues>.
